## What is 'VCS' (version control system)?

# VCS  -> Version Control System
  

### what is 'VCS'  
- It is a software or system used for managing different versions (changes) in the working project.
- it manages and considers only the changes in the project and not all the files.


### naive way to implement 'VCS'  
let, we have a ```project-1``` directory, inside it, we will store our project files...  
to begin with, ```project-1``` look like this :

- ```packages``` is a large directory containing all the necessary files/modules for the project.
- ```readMe.txt``` is normal text file. 
  
 
```readMe.txt``` contains:
>Welcome


#### Now we have a need that we want the exact code and files as ```project-1``` but having different version of ```readMe.txt```  

  
#### What should be done now?
- make another directory ```project-2```
- copy all the data from ```project-1``` to ```project-2```
- change ```readMe.txt```  

*** now we have, ***

```project-2``` look like this


![pr-2.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1664532578655/VmYPlFnZb.png align="left")  
  
```readMe.txt``` contains:
>Hello world
 
  
### But what's the catch here?
We have copied the entire project just to manage a minute change in the ```readMe.txt```, and that's not efficient.  
If we have had giga-bytes of data in ```packages``` directory then how would we even copy and store such a large file.  


#### In the above example 
Everything is same, the file structure, the ```packages``` directory, the only difference is in the ```readMe.txt```.
  
#### so what if we have had a way to consider only the changes in the project whatever change it is, and leave the other non-changed files as they are...  
  

  
### and that's why there we seek the need for ```VCS```.
```VCS``` only considers and counts the changes in the project and put intact the remaining data/files.  
  
#### Therefore, for above example ```VCS``` only tracks the  ```readMe.txt``` as the ```packages``` directory is same in both versions of the project hence will be kind of 'ignored', and only the changes in ```readMe.txt``` will be maintained.


#### So by implementing the ```VCS``` we can literally jump back and forth in different versions of the project...
